This boilerplate is built using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so you will want to read the User Guide for more goodies.

Use `npm install` to build.
`npm start` runs the server and opens the application in a browser.

## App Info

This is the start of a basic message logging application that allows message submission and printing capabilities.

The initial state of the application is that a user can submit a message in the left half of the screen and see the message on the right half.

## Tasks

- Add timestamp display to the message listing.
- Add the ability to enter a display name along with the message that is shown in the message listing.
  - The display name and message should both be required in order to submit.
- Enable editing of posted messages when the user clicks on a message in the listing.
